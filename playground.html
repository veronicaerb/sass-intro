  <h1>Grace Hopper <br><i class="normal">Computer Scientist and Admiral</i></h1>

  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper,_USN_(covered).jpg" title="Commodore Grace M. Hopper, USN"><img class="pull-left" src="480px-Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper.jpg" alt=""></a>

  <p class="lead">Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.</p>

  <p>She conceptualized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, one of the first modern programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer). Owing to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace". The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>

  <p>Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray in New York City. She was the oldest in a family of three children. She was curious as a child, a lifelong trait; at the age of seven she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked, and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[8] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.</p>
<p>In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore.[9][10] Her dissertation, New Types of Irreducibility Criteria, was published that same year.[11] Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[12]</p>
<p>She was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–76) from 1930 until their divorce in 1945.[9][13] She never remarried, and she kept his surname.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

  <h3>World War II</h3>

<p>In 1943, during World War II, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve, one of many women to volunteer to serve in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her age (38). She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.[14]</p>

<h3>COBOL</h3>
<p>In the spring of 1959, a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) brought together computer experts from industry and government. Hopper served as the technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.[17]
From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973.[14] She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.[14]

  <blockquote>
    <p>The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, "Do you think we can do this?" I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances."[25] <small>— Grace Hopper, <cite title="Particular Passions: Grace Murray Hopper.

<h3>Awards and recognition</h3>
  <ul>
	<li>1969: Hopper was awarded the inaugural "computer sciences man of the year" award from the Data Processing Management Association.[26]</li>
	<li>1971: The annual Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Computer Professionals was established in 1971 by the Association for Computing Machinery.
		<ul><li>The Grace Murray Hopper Awards (named for computer pioneer RADM Grace Hopper) has been awarded by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) since 1971. The award goes to a computer professional who makes a single, significant technical or service contribution at or before age 35.</li></ul></li>
	<li>1973: She became the first person from the United States and the first woman of any nationality to be made a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.</li>
	<li>1982: She received the American Association of University Women Achievement Award.</li>
	<li>1986: Upon her retirement, she received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.</li>
	<li>1987: She became a Computer History Museum Fellow Award Recipient.[27]</li>
	<li>1988: She received the Golden Gavel Award at the Toastmasters International convention in Washington, DC.</li>
	<li>1991: She received the National Medal of Technology.</li>
	<li>1996: USS Hopper (DDG-70) was launched. Nicknamed Amazing Grace, it is on a very short list of U.S. military vessels named after women.</li>
	<li>2001: Eavan Boland wrote a poem dedicated to Grace Hopper titled "Code" in her 2001 release Against Love Poetry.</li>
	<li>2009: The Department of Energy's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center named its flagship system "Hopper".[28]</li>
	<li>2013: Google made the Google Doodle for Hopper's 107th birthday an animation of her sitting at a computer, using COBOL to print out her age. At the end of the animation, a moth flies out of the computer.[29][30]</li>
	<li>2013: The "Hopper" was first proposed as a unit exactly 30 cm long, and roughly equivalent to foot in English speaking countries.[31]</li>

    <dt>COBOL</dt>
    <dd>COBOL /ˈkoʊbɒl/ is one of the oldest programming languages, primarily designed by Grace Hopper. Its name is an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language, defining its primary domain in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.</dd>
    <dt>UNIVAC I</dt>
    <dd>The UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic Computer I) was the second commercial computer produced in the United States.[1] It was designed principally by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the inventors of the ENIAC.</dd>
    <dd>The first UNIVAC was accepted by the United States Census Bureau on March 31, 1951, and was dedicated on June 14 that year.[2][3] The fifth machine (built for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission) was used by CBS to predict the result of the 1952 presidential election. With a sample of just 1% of the voting population it famously predicted an Eisenhower landslide while the conventional wisdom favored Stevenson.[4]</dd>
